# release-task

A package to automate releasing for git projects. Out of the box this package does the following:

- `bump`: Increment the `package.json` file version property, to add more files see the options below.
- `changelog`: Updates the changelog with the latest commits that has not been pushed to origin.
- `commit`: Commit those files which had version constraint bumped i.e: `package.json`, `changelog.md`.
- `tag`: Create a new annotated tag for the new release version.

### Install

```bash
$ npm i release-task --save-dev
```

### Usage

Create a script file that could be run via npm scripts like:
`./scripts/release.js`

```js
const releaseTask = require('release-task');
tasks.init();
```

Add a new script within `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "node ./scripts/release.js"
  }
}
```

```bash
$ npm run release
```

> To see how this package handle releasing commits, changelog and tags take a look

> and [tag releases](https://github.com/adrianorsouza/release-task/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

### Adding custom tasks

Tasks are function that do something and return a Promise, by default there are 4 tasks setup, but it's
possible to create your own task to run after the default tasks are completed.

Tasks are queued, in order to executed each step without missing something on the way,
i.e commit a file without changelog content being updated. So because of this we run
tasks as an array of functions in series using [run-series](https://github.com/feross/run-series).

### Function Tasks

Every task receives two params, the incremented version string, and the configuration options:

```js
async function task(version, options) {
  // Task body is basically:
  // do something with the already incremented version
  // access to the config options
  // onError throw any message string
  // onSuccess return a message string
  const someAsyncMethod = () => {};
  const result = await someAsyncMethod();
  if (result) {
    throw new Error('Error Message!');
  }
  return 'Success Message!';
}
```

When build a custom task the function will always receive the bumbed version and the options of the prompt.
